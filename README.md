Please download this webextension from [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab-open-in-private/)

I created this webextension with no prior knowledge of the webextensions API or javascript out of sheer necessity. The features were going away with Firefox 57 and I wanted them back, so I did what I had to. The code inside is bound to be bad and lame and also bad. If you want to fork this and make your own webextension, please do. If you want to submit changes back to me, please do.
